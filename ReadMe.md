# Game of Gala

For my cousin's daughter birthday, I was planning to make a small game. In it, she would have to win a series of minigames, each of which will give her a piece of message. Overall, she would find the message she needs to complete the story. The pictures have some text in Spanish, because she is 7 so I can't do it in English.

That story is an adventure which involves all the members of my family. Since I'm not sure they want to be public, I just substituted their fotos by pictures from the internet.

There are several files to make this game. Each of the minigames will be a file. So far I only have a labyrinth. And then the MainFile connects them all. There are also many pictures kept on the folder data.
