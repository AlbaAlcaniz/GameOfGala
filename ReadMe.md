# Game of Gala

For my cousin's daughter birthday, I was planning to make a small game. In it, she would have to win a series of minigames, each of which will give her a piece of message. Overall, she would find the message she needs to complete the adventure. I have changed the game so that it is in English. The main spell is in Spanish, but I have added an explanation. The situations are related to my family's hobbies and stories, so it's funny for us.

There are several files to make this game. Each of the minigames will be a python file. They are all connected by the main file. There is also a data file which makes the transition between each of the games. The game includes pictures and music, whose files are kept in their corresponding folders. The game was originally made with pictures of my family, but I have replaced them by pictures from the internet.

I have also created a .exe version of the game. However, the file is too big for GitHub so I wasn't able to place it here.
