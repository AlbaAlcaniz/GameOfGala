# Game of Gala

For my cousin's daughter birthday, I was planning to make a small game. In it, she would have to win a series of minigames, each of which will give her a message. On it, she will learn while playing. But, let's be realistic, the person who's going to take the most ouf of it is myself. But it feels nice to do something for someone you love.

The characters of the game are my family. Since I'm not really sure they want to be public, I just removed them by pictures from the internet.
