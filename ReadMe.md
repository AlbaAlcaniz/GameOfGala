# Game of Gala

For my cousin's daughter birthday, I was planning to make a small game. In it, she would have to win a series of minigames, each of which will give her a piece of message. Overall, she would find the message she needs to complete the adventure. The pictures have some text in Spanish, because she is 7 so I can't do it in English.

There are several files to make this game. Each of the minigames will be a python file. They all will be connected by the MainFile. All the pictures used by these files are kept on the data folder.
